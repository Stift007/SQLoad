# SQLoad
Simple SQLite3-Database GUI Browser made with TKinter

The CLI-Version of this would be [This](https://github.com/Stift007/sqlbash)  

## How to use SQLoad?
After starting up the Program, Click File > Open and Navigate to your Database.  
Small disadvantage: The Program doesn't detect changes, so after changing the Database or running Code through the SQLoad Editor,  
you need to File > Refresh the Database

### The Editor
SQLoad comes with a SQL Editor (The SQL-Dropdown in  the Menubar)  
It allows executing single Statements or bulk-executing Statements that are commited directly to the Database

All in all, a nice tool I made, but not useful in a larger setting.  

In the Future, I recommend using [Querify](https://github.com/stift007/querify)
